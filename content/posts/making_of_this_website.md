title: Making of this website

I finally got around doing my own online presentation. After some playing around with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) I decided to put together something minimalistic and simply looking. For now I oriented myself around just the idea of [posts](/posts) that sometimes describe a project I made. I separate them by a `projects` tag.

Projects added from the past (Before 2025) have a derived date from the photos or files I made back in that time. They might be actually older, but accurate enough form some sort of a timeline.

Hope you enjoy your time here! :)
